# MarketFlow.VIP Design System Overview

Welcome to the design system for the MarketFlow.VIP landing page. This system is built upon Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, emphasizing a clean, modern dark-theme aesthetic inspired by DesignJoy, with a focus on clear typography, consistent spacing, and high-conversion principles.

The design prioritizes:
- Fully responsive design for all breakpoints.
- Modern theme (primarily light in current implementation) with carefully crafted typography and spacing.
- Clean, readable UI with strong visual hierarchy.
- High-conversion optimized CTAs and content flow.

## Core Documentation

Navigate through the sections to understand different aspects of our design language:

- [**Frontend Development Guidelines**](./00-frontend-guidelines.mdc) - **START HERE** for file structure, naming, and coding practices.
- [**Visual Identity**](./01-visual-identity.mdc) - Typography, color palette, spacing.
- [**Responsive Design**](./02-responsive-design.mdc) - Breakpoints and adaptations.
- [**Animation & Interaction**](./03-animation-interaction.mdc) - Micro-interactions and motion.
- [**Content Style**](./04-content-style.mdc) - Imagery, tone of voice.
- [**Special Design Patterns**](./05-special-patterns.mdc) - Key UI patterns like Hero, Cards, etc.

## Implementation Philosophy

When implementing or extending this design system:
- **Prioritize `src/app/globals.css`:** This file is the source of truth for core CSS custom properties (variables) and base component styling (`@layer components`).
- **Leverage Tailwind CSS:** Utilize utility classes for most styling needs.
- **Reusable Components:** Build and use components from `src/components/` for consistent UI.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components and content are accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes).
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in spacing, typography, and color usage across all new development.
